            <h2>Suggestions for Use</h2>
            <p>(These ideas won't necessarily be compatible with all movement patterns.  They're primarily geared toward resistance exercises, with which sets/ reps are popularly used)</p>
            <p>
              <b>1 Exercise: </b>perform as 5-20 minute EMOM or, alternatively, in 30-seconds-on/ 30-seconds-off format.<br>
              <b>2 Exercises: </b>perform as couplet, 3-5 rounds for time.<br>
              <b>3 Exercises: </b>perform as triplet, 10-minute AMRAP.<br>
              <b>4-10 Exercises: </b>perform as chipper- complete all reps of 1 exercise (no matter how many sets it takes) before moving on to next exercise.  Adjust intensity and volume of each exercise so that training session lasts 30-60 minutes.<br>
              <b>1-10 Exercises: </b>(see above)
