        <h2>Suggestions for Use</h2>
        <p>(Not all of these ideas will necessarily apply to all movement patterns)</p>
        <p>
          <b>1 Exercise: </b>perform as 5-20 minute EMOM or, alternatively, in 30-seconds-on/ 30-seconds-off format.<br>
          <b>2 Exercises: </b>perform as couplet, 3-5 rounds for time.<br>
          <b>3 Exercises: </b>perform as triplet, 10-minute AMRAP.<br>
          <b>4-10 Exercises: </b>perform as chipper- complete all reps of 1 exercise (no matter how many sets it takes) before moving on to next exercise.  Adjust intensity and volume of each exercise so that training session lasts 30-60 minutes.<br>
          <b>1-10 Exercises: </b>(see above)
